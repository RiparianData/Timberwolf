## An example configuration, you can copy this to
## testing.properties in the current directory where you're
## running the tests, most likely the same directory as the
## pom.xml file.
## More information on running the tests is available online:
## https://github.com/RiparianData/Timberwolf/wiki/Running-the-tests

###############################################################
## Necessary for the integration tests that hit an actual hbase
###############################################################
## The ZooKeeper quorum used to connect to HBase.
# ZooKeeperQuorum = hbase.int.test
## The ZooKeeper client port used to connect to HBase.
# ZooKeeperClientPort = 2181


###############################################################
## Necessary for the integration tests that hit an actual
## exchange server
###############################################################
## The URI of the Exchange instance. Whatever you have will
## most certainly need to end with "/ews/exchange.asmx"
# ExchangeURI = https://exchange.int.test/ews/exchange.asmx
## The domain for users
# LdapDomain = int.test
## The jaas config entry to be used from the java login
## configuration usually located at ~/.java.login.config
# LdapConfigEntry = Timberwolf
#######
## Users necessary for exchange tests
#######
## The following 5 users are required for the exchange integration
## test. The authenticated user must be able to impersonate all
## of these users, and no one else, in order to be able to run the
## test.
## These users will create a bunch of folders and send a bunch of
## emails amongst themselves and put them in said folders.
## When the test ends wipe out the contents of their mailboxes.
## I repeat at the end of the test these users lose ALL their
## emails. DO NOT use real users here.

## Instructions for how to set up the users is available online:
## https://github.com/RiparianData/Timberwolf/wiki/Running-the-tests


## User #1 has a bunch of emails organized into many folders
# ExchangeUser1 = testingUser1

## User #2 has a few emails in a few folders
# ExchangeUser2 = testingUser2

## User #3 has a few emails in a few folders
# ExchangeUser3 = testingUser3

## Sender sends all the emails and recieves a few more emails
# ExchangeSender = testingUserForSending

## Ignored is just another account that can receive emails
## like sender this account is ignored when putting emails in hbase
# ExchangeIgnoredUser = testingUserForRecieving
